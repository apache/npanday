NPanday MSDeploy Maven Plugin

  The MSDeploy Maven Plugin is a wrapper for {{{http://www.iis.net/download/webdeploy}Microsoft Web Deploy}},
  also called MSDeploy. It picks up the collected package files (for example collected by
  {{{../aspnet-maven-plugin/index.html}aspnet-maven-plugin}}) and packs them to a zip (*.msdeploy.zip)
  which can be used for deployment both manually and with the MSDeploy commandline tool.

  Deploying directly to remote destinations though Maven/NPanday is currently not supported.

  Have a look at the {{{./usage.html}usage documentation}} in order to find out how to configure it for
  your project.
