Using the NPanday ASP.NET Maven Plugin

* Prerequisites

  Microsoft Web Deploy, also called MSDeploy, must be installed.

  * {{{http://www.iis.net/download/webdeploy}Web Deploy 2.0 Download}}

* Usage

  In order to enable the packaging, add the plugin to your POMs build
  configuration.

+---+
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.npanday.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>msdeploy-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>create-package</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
+---+

  Remember that you will also need to configure the {{{../aspnet-maven-plugin/index.html}aspnet-maven-plugin}} to
  prepare the package, in case you want to package a web application:

+---+
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.npanday.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>aspnet-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>assemble-package-files</goal>
        <goal>process-configs</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
+---+

  For further configuration options have a look at the {{{./plugin-info.html}Plugin Goals}}.
