Integration Test

  Integration test is run on projects that contains the plugin <<<maven-test-plugin>>> under the POM build configuration.
  
  Since integration test itself is for testing, the <<<\<testSourceDirectory\>>>> is no longer needed and the <<<\<sourceDirectory\>>>>
  is enough to be able to run the project test successfully. The following POM snippet is an example build configuration of an integration test project.

+------+
  <build>
    <sourceDirectory>./</sourceDirectory>
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
      <groupId>npanday.plugin</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-test-plugin</artifactId>
      <extensions>true</extensions>
      <configuration>
        <integrationTest>true</integrationTest>
      </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
+------+

  To run the test, simply import the project and execute the NPanday's test goal. You can refer to {{{importing.html} Importing Projects}}
  and {{{execute_goals.html} Test}} sections for instructions on importing and executing test goal respectively.
