* Verify the integrity of the files

 We recommend that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP signatures and MD5 checksums.

 The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the {{{http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/npanday/KEYS}KEYS}}
 as well as the asc signature file for the particular distribution. Make sure you get these files from
 {{{http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/npanday/}the main distribution directory}},
 rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using


 % pgpk -a KEYS

 % pgpv ${filename}.tar.gz.asc

 or

 % pgp -ka KEYS

 % pgp ${filename}.tar.gz.asc

 or

 % gpg --import KEYS

 % gpg --verify ${filename}.tar.gz.asc

 You can also verify the MD5 signature on the files. A Unix program called md5 or md5sum is included in many
 Unix distributions. It is also available as part of {{{http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/}GNU Coreutils}}.
 Windows users can get binary md5 programs from {{{http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/}Fourmilab}},
 {{{http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console}PC-Tools}} or {{{http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/}SlavaSoft}}.
